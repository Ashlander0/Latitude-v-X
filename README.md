# Latitude v X

Hosted URL: https://ashlander0.github.io/Latitude-v-X/

---

This is a small website built using the Bootstrap framework and styled with CSS. The data is comparing the effect that Latitude may have different weather conditions, such as temperature and humidity. There was a fairly strong correlation between Lat and Temperature, but the remaining tested conditions did not seem to be directly effected by Latitude.

## Usage
In the top Navbar you can find a dropdown menu to select one of various effects measured against Latitude. There is also a Comparisons page that displays all four visualizations side by side for comparison. The last option in the Navbar is Data, which provides the raw data in html form.
