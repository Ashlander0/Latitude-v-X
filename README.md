This was an assignment in the Data Visualization and Analytics bootcamp through the UMN.

This is a small website built using the Bootstrap framework and styled with CSS. The data is comparing the effect that Latitude may have different weather conditions, such as temperature and humidity. There was a fairly strong correlation between Lat and Temperature, but the remaining tested conditions did not seem to be directly effected by Latitude.
